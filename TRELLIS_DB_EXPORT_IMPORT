// Exporting Trellis WP_DATABASE for provisioning

I've been deploying Trellis sites for months now and I still miss this most of the time.

@andrew40 also don't forget that you'll need to manually import/upload your uploads and database after deploying. Here's a quick rundown:

1) ssh to your Vagrant box and export your database:
$ cd trellis && vagrant ssh

2) change directories to your web root on the Vagrant box and export your db to a dumpfile:
$ cd /srv/www/yourdomain.com/current/
$ wp db export

3) copy Uploads folder from vagrant to local
$ scp -rpP 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1:/srv/www/appedemic.nl/shared/uploads/* uploads/ [Run in folder you want to copy to]

4) Push uploads to remote host 
$ rsync -a /Users/relic/Sites/[LOCAL PATH] root@[ADRES]:/srv/www/SITENAME/shared

5) exit the ssh session (type exit) and find the database dump file in your Trellis directory named something like yourdomain_com_development.sql. Upload the dump file to your DO droplet in /srv/www/yourdomain.com/current. I usually just use an (S)FTP client for this. Also while you're there copy your uploads directory from site/web/app/ to /srv/www/yourdomain.com/shared/

6) ssh to your DO droplet, change directories to your web root:
$ ssh web@yourdomain.com
$ cd /srv/www/yourdomain.com/current

7) Trellis automatically sets up WordPress in when you deploy, but doesn't set up your database, so reset the database and import your dumpfile:
$ wp db reset
$ wp db import yourdomain_com_development.sql

8) Search and replace your development URL with your production URL:
$wp search-replace yourdomain.dev yourdomain.com
